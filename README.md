# PLUGIN: Total Sales plugin for WooCommerce

A simple plugin to show basic sales figures for products for 3 possible time periods: last 24 hours, last 7 days and last month.

Also has additional tab for filter data on a per country/per period basis.

All table columns are sortable on click.

Should work out of the box, but might require some mods for your use case. Feel free to do so.
